# Module Patterns

Focused YAML examples for module invocation styles.

## Patterns

- [`single-invocation/`](single-invocation/) - One call with `with`.
- [`multi-instance/`](multi-instance/) - One call expanded to many instances with `instances`.

Both directories include their own `modules/pipelines.py` so you can copy them independently.
